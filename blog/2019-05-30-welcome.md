SkyeKiwi Update on May 15, 2022. 

Hi All, it's been a while since we have updated our progress. We have brought some exciting progress. 

1. The Testnet Alpha is LIVE! 

After one whole month of testing, our first testnet is finally deployed. It features full capacities to deploy secret smart contract, interact with secret smart contracts with the first shard. As we talked about earlier: the first shard is a NEAR compatible shard, you would be able to write and deploy your existing NEAR smart contract with minimal edits. 

Just like any very initial testnet, expect bugs! After all, the whole point of a testnet is to test. 

2. Our discord server is LIVE!

Welcome
